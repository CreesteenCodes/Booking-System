# 🎟️ Booking System
A simple C++ **console-based ticketing application** designed as a student project.

# 📝 Overview
The **FlixTicket System** is a small C++ project that simulates a basic movie ticket booking system in a console environment.

It allows users to **create**, **view**, and **manage movie ticket bookings** using a simple text-based interface.

This project is implemented in a single file, `main.cpp`, and is ideal for learning basic C++ programming concepts such as:
- Input/output handling
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Functions
- Simple data management

# 📂 Files of Interest
- `main.cpp` — Main source code and program logic.
- `FlixTicket.cbp` — Code::Blocks project file (optional; for those using Code::Blocks IDE).

# ⚙️ Build Instructions (Windows - PowerShell)
You can compile the program using any modern C++ compiler such as **g++ (MinGW)** or **Microsoft Visual Studio**.

**Using g++ (MinGW):**

```powershell
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall -o FlixTicket.exe main.cpp
```

**Run the Program:**

```powershell
.\FlixTicket.exe
```

**Using Visual Studio:**
Open FlixTicket.cbp in Code::Blocks or create a new Visual Studio project, then add main.cpp as your source file.

# 🧩 Dependencies
No external libraries required — uses only the **Standard C++ Library**.
